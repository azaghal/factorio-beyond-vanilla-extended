Beyond Vanilla - Extended
=========================


About
-----

*Beyond Vanilla - Extended* is a modpack designed to extend and expand upon vanilla gameplay, adding more structures, mechanics, and ways to automate the factory. The modpack builds on top of [Beyond Vanilla - QoL](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/beyond-vanilla-qol) and [Beyond Vanilla - QoL+](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/beyond-vanilla-qol-plus) modpacks.

It is designed for players that have already went through a couple of vanilla playthroughs, and have started to find the vanilla gameplay repetitive. Modpack is focused on maintaining the balance while filling-in the gaps in vanilla gameplay.

Design decisions for the modpack are (in addition to those outlined by *Beyond Vanilla - QoL/QoL+* modpacks):

- Improve/smooth out the technological progression.
- Expand upon puzzle aspects of factory building.
- Expand the end-game.

This does mean that at least *some* of the restrictions related to game balancing/feel from the base modpacks are ignored. The modpack does *deviate in one very important segment as well* - since most of the bigger game-changing mods seem to utilise non-free licensing, this particular restriction has been dropped as well (otherwise there would be fairly limited content available for extending the vanilla game mechanics).


Features
--------

Listed features build on top of [Beyond Vanilla - QoL](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/beyond-vanilla-qol) and [Beyond Vanilla - QoL+](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/beyond-vanilla-qol-plus) modpacks. Please make sure to check out the feature list there as well.


### End Game

-   Victory requires multiple expensive rocket launches ([Space Extension Mod](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/SpaceMod))

    > In order to win the game, it is no longer sufficient to merely launch a single rocket in order to escape the planet. Instead, multiple highly expensive (both research-wise and resource-wise) launches are required, with each putting a significant strain on your end game base, and leading to a natural transition towards a proper mega-base.

-   Mine for resources in the asteroid belt ([Asteroid Mining](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Asteroid_Mining))

    > Once no longer planet-bound, the resources of the asteroid belt are yours for the taking - just make sure to properly configure the resource collection rockets by equipping them with the correct mining module.


### Power Generation

-   Extended power-generation based on burnables ([Superheating](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Superheating))

    > Utilise oil and its byproducts for early-game power-generation, and upgrade your existing boiler-based set-up with super-heaters and (early unlock) steam turbines. Provides for a nice intermediate step towards nuclear-based powed production, and gives all that coal some interesting use even in the late game.

-   Plutonium-based power generation and weapons ([PlutoniumEnergy](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/PlutoniumEnergy))

    > Move beyond mere uranium processing and power generation, and utilise new research and production chains that give you access to plutonium-based reactors and weapons.

-   Produce steam using electricity ([Electric Boiler](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/electricboiler))

    > Simplify steam production for coal liquification, or use electric boilers to convert and store excess energy as steam.

-   Power production and storage using stone walls ([Solar Walls](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/solar-walls) and [Accumulator Walls](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/accumulator-walls))

    > Build a literal power wall around your base or outposts. Bring green energy to all that real-estate wasted on keeping the local eco-activists out.


Known issues
------------

In addition to items listed here, please also have a look at known issues for [Beyond Vanilla - QoL+](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/beyond-vanilla-qol-plus) modpack.

-   The [Solar Walls](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/solar-walls) and [Accumulator Walls](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/accumulator-walls) research lacks the technology pre-requisite on regular stone walls - despite having to use regular stone walls to craft them. Just don't forget to research regular stone walls as well.


Contributions
-------------

Bugs and feature requests can be reported through discussion threads or through project's issue tracker. For general questions, please use discussion threads.

Pull requests for implementing new features and fixing encountered issues are always welcome.

As the old metaphor goes, this modpack stands on the shoulders of the giants. It would never be possible to create if it were not for both Wube Software's dedication to the game and its modding capabilities, nor without the many modders that have selflessly contributed their time and effort to creation of all the wonderous mods that are included in this modpack.

I salute you, and thank you for making all of this possible and available in such a user-friendly form!
