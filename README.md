Beyond Vanilla - Extended
=========================


About
-----

*Beyond Vanilla - Extended* is a modpack designed to extend and expand upon vanilla gameplay, adding more structures, mechanics, and ways to automate the factory. The modpack builds on top of [Beyond Vanilla - QoL](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/beyond-vanilla-qol) and [Beyond Vanilla - QoL+](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/beyond-vanilla-qol-plus) modpacks.

It is designed for players that have already went through a couple of vanilla playthroughs, and have started to find the vanilla gameplay repetitive. Modpack is focused on maintaining the balance while filling-in the gaps in vanilla gameplay.

Design decisions for the modpack are (in addition to those outlined by *Beyond Vanilla - QoL/QoL+* modpacks):

- Improve/smooth out the technological progression.
- Expand upon puzzle aspects of factory building.
- Expand the end-game.

This does mean that at least *some* of the restrictions related to game balancing/feel from the base modpacks are ignored. The modpack does *deviate in one very important segment as well* - since most of the bigger game-changing mods seem to utilise non-free licensing, this particular restriction has been dropped as well (otherwise there would be fairly limited content available for extending the vanilla game mechanics).


Features
--------

Listed features build on top of [Beyond Vanilla - QoL](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/beyond-vanilla-qol) and [Beyond Vanilla - QoL+](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/beyond-vanilla-qol-plus) modpacks. Please make sure to check out the feature list there as well.


### End Game

-   Victory requires multiple expensive rocket launches ([Space Extension Mod](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/SpaceMod))

    > In order to win the game, it is no longer sufficient to merely launch a single rocket in order to escape the planet. Instead, multiple highly expensive (both research-wise and resource-wise) launches are required, with each putting a significant strain on your end game base, and leading to a natural transition towards a proper mega-base.

-   Mine for resources in the asteroid belt ([Asteroid Mining](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Asteroid_Mining))

    > Once no longer planet-bound, the resources of the asteroid belt are yours for the taking - just make sure to properly configure the resource collection rockets by equipping them with the correct mining module.

-   Factory-oriented statistics in victory screen ([Better Victory Screen](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/better-victory-screen))

    > Get factory/production-oriented statistics after winning the game. Because, you know, if this game was really about killing biters, it would probably be called Biterio...


### Circuit network

-   Measure total accumulator charge and capacity ([Capacity Combinator](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/capacity-combinator)

    > Access information about total stored energy and energy capacity, and utilise these values in circuit network. Prioritise different means of production based on available charge, or control which parts of the factory get cut off when the stored energy is low.

-   Daylight, motion, pollution, and pressure plate sensors ([Kontraptions](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Kontraptions))

    > Use extra set of sensors to automate even more of your factory! For those long sessions when you can't quite figure out if it's still daylight or not...

-   Wireless signals ([Kontraptions](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Kontraptions))

    > Wirelessly connect circuit networks across vastness of wilderness. Redirect some of those free circuit wires into *important* parts of the factory!


### Combat

-   Remotely activate explosives ([Kontraptions](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Kontraptions))

    > Use the power of circuit network to blow up explosives from a distance. (Mostly) safe way to cause more mayhem and destruction.

-   Early game fire ([Kontraptions](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Kontraptions))

    > Crash-land on planet, then set the nearby flora and fauna on fire using primitive. Don't play with matches - use the latest discovery from 5000 years ago - tinderbox!


### Logistics

-   Denser pipe builds and fluid flow control ([Flow Control](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Flow%20Control))

    > Use rotatable pipes that connect in fixed direction for compact factory builds, and for avoiding fluid mixing. Use the valves to control the flow of fluids without having to resort to powered pumps.

-   Configure input/output layout for fluid crafting ([Fluid Permutations Fixed](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/fluid_permutations_fixed))

    > Improve the symmetry and efficiency of your oil-cracking set-ups by configuring the positiong of machine fluid inputs and outputs.

-   Additional fluid storage tanks ([Large Storage Tank](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/large-storage-tank) and [Extra Storage Tank: Minibuffer](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/extra-storage-tank-minibuffer))

    > Additional fluid tanks for convenience. Useful for both massive oil processing and having smaller local buffers for defensive purposes.

-   Specialised fluid pipes for increased flow rates ([Fluid Must Flow](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/FluidMustFlow))

    > Use specialised machinery and pipes to transfer large qunatities of fluids at high rates over long distances.

-   Upgraded version of construction and logistics bots ([Hercules Robots](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/hercules-robots))

    > Late-game upgrade to your construction and logistics automation needs. Harder, better, faster, stronger.

-   Additional (larger) storage containers ([AAI Containers](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/aai-containers))

    > Enjoy more item storage options, and experiment with new layouts for all of your loading, unloading, and buffering needs. Additional containers ranging from 2x2 to 6x6 in size.

-   Configurable inserter pick-up and drop-off positions ([Side Inserters](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Side%20Inserters))

    > Shake-up your traditional builds by using inserters that can work at a 90-degree angle, and pick what side of the belt to drop off the items at.

-   Fluid transfer using bots ([Logistic Tank](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/logistic-tanks))

    > Move fluids around using robots without barreling and unbarreling using dedicated fluid tank logistic variants. Just make sure to install that barrel into the bot itself...

-   Early-game robot logistics ([Kontraptions](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Kontraptions))

    > Deliver items to remote locations using one-time use long range delivery drones.


### Miscellaneous

-   Relocate the shipwreck/set respawn point ([Relocatable Shipwreck](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/relocatable-shipwreck))

    > Are you nostalgic about your life as a failed pilot? You like keeping all the junk around? Can't bear yourself to disassemble your old trusty ship? Then worry no more - you can simply pick up your trashed spaceship, and plop it somewhere else. To top it off, this also sets your respawn point. Just make sure not to destroy it by accident... **NOTE:** To recolor the shipwreck once it has been moved, please use the `/recolor-crash-site` console command.

-   Signposts - with icon support ([Kontraptions](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Kontraptions))

    > Sometimes an icon is not enough. Sometimes, you need to send a message to all those passing by... Craft and place signposts for reminders, insults, and fun!


### Power Generation

-   Extended power-generation based on burnables ([Superheating](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Superheating))

    > Utilise oil and its byproducts for early-game power-generation, and upgrade your existing boiler-based set-up with super-heaters and (early unlock) steam turbines. Provides for a nice intermediate step towards nuclear-based powed production, and gives all that coal some interesting use even in the late game.

-   Plutonium-based power generation and weapons ([PlutoniumEnergy](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/PlutoniumEnergy))

    > Move beyond mere uranium processing and power generation, and utilise new research and production chains that give you access to plutonium-based reactors and weapons.

-   Produce steam using electricity ([Electric Boiler](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/electricboiler))

    > Simplify steam production for coal liquification, or use electric boilers to convert and store excess energy as steam.

-   Power production and storage using stone walls ([Solar Walls](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/solar-walls) and [Accumulator Walls](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/accumulator-walls))

    > Build a literal power wall around your base or outposts. Bring green energy to all that real-estate wasted on keeping the local eco-activists out.

-   Improved solar power production and storage ([Advanced Solar HR](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Advanced-Electric-Revamped-v16))

    > Additional tiers of solar panels and accumulators. Compromise with the local eco-activists, and lean into space-efficient power production. Just make sure they never see the factory that produced all of them...

-   Traversable solar panels ([Flat Solar Panels - Solar Freakin' Roadway](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Flat-Solar))

    > Build the road? Or solar panels? Why not both? Replace the immobile, blocking variants of solar panels with fully animated variants that retract and extend as you approach them by foot or by car. Eases base traversal and makes for a fantastic Mexican wave.


### Transportation

-   Additional asphalt-based road tiles ([Asphalt Roads](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/AsphaltPaving))

    > Introduces asphalt-based road tiles, providing faster vehicle/walking speed and more decoration options.


### Visuals

-   Improved glow effects for reactors and heat pipes ([Realistic Reactor Glow](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/RealisticReactorGlow) and [Realistic Heat Glow](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Realistic_Heat_Glow))

    > Enjoy the glow colour of a nuclear reaction the way *scientistis* intended it, and get a small boost to your visual experience through improved glow effects for the heat pipe elements.

-   Realistically looking ores ([Realistic Ores](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/RealisticOres))

    > Have a small dose of reality added back to the game by having the correct colour/texture schemes for in-game ores, or... Get massively confused as you struggle to understand that iron and copper ore patch colours are now reversed in the game after hundreds of hours of play-time.

-   Vegetation-free concrete ([Cleaned Concrete](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/CleanedConcrete))

    > Get rid of shurbbery and weeds when placing concrete. Stamp out those plants for good.

-   Torches ([Kontraptions](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Kontraptions))

    > Light-up the early game factory by placing down primitive stone-age technology - a torch.


Known issues
------------

In addition to items listed here, please also have a look at known issues for [Beyond Vanilla - QoL+](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/beyond-vanilla-qol-plus) modpack.

-   The [Solar Walls](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/solar-walls) and [Accumulator Walls](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/accumulator-walls) research lacks the technology pre-requisite on regular stone walls - despite having to use regular stone walls to craft them. Just don't forget to research regular stone walls as well.
-   The [AAI Containers](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/aai-containers) mod is released under [non-Free license](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/categories.en.html).
-   Moving the shipwreck around (picking it up and placing it down again) desyncs the shipwreck colour. This is a known incompatibility/limitation of the [Tinted Spaceship](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/tinted-spaceship) and [Relocatable Shipwreck](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/relocatable-shipwreck) mods.
