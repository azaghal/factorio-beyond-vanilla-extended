Beyond Vanilla - Extended
=========================


About
-----

*Beyond Vanilla - Extended* is a modpack designed to extend and expand upon vanilla gameplay, adding more structures, mechanics, and ways to automate the factory. The modpack builds on top of [Beyond Vanilla - QoL](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/beyond-vanilla-qol) and [Beyond Vanilla - QoL+](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/beyond-vanilla-qol-plus) modpacks.

It is designed for players that have already went through a couple of vanilla playthroughs, and have started to find the vanilla gameplay repetitive. Modpack is focused on maintaining the balance while filling-in the gaps in vanilla gameplay.

Design decisions for the modpack are (in addition to those outlined by *Beyond Vanilla - QoL/QoL+* modpacks):

- Improve/smooth out the technological progression.
- Expand upon puzzle aspects of factory building.
- Expand the end-game.

This does mean that at least *some* of the restrictions related to game balancing/feel from the base modpacks are ignored. The modpack does *deviate in one very important segment as well* - since most of the bigger game-changing mods seem to utilise non-free licensing, this particular restriction has been dropped as well (otherwise there would be fairly limited content available for extending the vanilla game mechanics).

Credits

As the old metaphor goes, this modpack stands on the shoulders of the giants. It would never be possible to create if it were not for both Wube Software's dedication to the game and its modding capabilities, nor without the many modders that have selflessly contributed their time and effort to creation of all the wonderous mods that are included in this modpack.

I salute you, and thank you for making all of this possible and available in such a user-friendly form!
